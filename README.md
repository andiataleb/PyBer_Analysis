# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

As a data analysit at a ride-sharing app company, I was tasked to perform an analysis to create a summary for studying the relationship between average weekly fare, number of rides and number of drivers in different city types (Urban, Suburban, Rural). The purpose of this analysis is to help the company to make decision for increading rideshare accessibility in undersrved neighborhoods.

## Results
In order to complete this task, I calculated the total fares, total rides and total drives as well as average fare for each city type using Python coding. In order to help the management team better understand the outcome, I created a multiple-line graph to show the weekly fares for each city type.
